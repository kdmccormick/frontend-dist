============================== REQUIRED FOR DEMO ==============================


Immediate issues in this repo:
* Dotenv issues.
    * Which env file(s) should we inject into?
    * How do we specify a .env file?
	* What's up with NODE_ENV? Does that relate to .env file?
	* Do I need to add more values to app .env files?
	* I think this is causing Gradebook and Program Console to give Nginx 404
      because it is trying to load /null?next=null...
* Payments gives blank page.
	* Because ---output-public-path doesn't seem to be working.
* Nginx config needs fixing
	* Nginx rewrite rules aren't letting React app handle routing.
		* Learning gives Nginx 404 on courses and blocks.
		* Profile gives Nginx 404 on user pages.
	* Also, rewrite rules should handle trailing slashes.

Devstack:
* Figure out volumes for live repositories.


============================ NOT REQUIRED FOR DEMO ============================

Clean up for this repo (in decreasing priority):
* Shared log_msg/log_warning/log_err functions instead of
  'echo -e "${COL}a message{NC}" >&2 for everything.
* Use 'set -x' instead of echoing commands.
* Use .dockerignore simplify repo structure.
* Makefile targets for docker push.
* Overrides for frontends.lst
* Comments in Makefile + auto-generated 'make help' rule.
* Add readme(s), including required folder structure.

External issues:
* Make login redirects work.
* Use relative paths in React (handled by 04-apply-shims.sh currently).
* Make env.development compatible (handled by 03-inject-config.sh currently).

Longer term:
* We assume repo name structure and locations. Should be more flexible.
* Move this to tubular or something.
* Config could be JSON.
* Automate docker builds.
