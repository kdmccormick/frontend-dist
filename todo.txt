Figure out how to inject configuration into microfrontends...
some values are in common (e.g. SUPPORT_URL), some are different
for each frontend (e.g. BASE_URL).

Figure out how to do `npm run webpack ...` in each repo instead
of brittle `$(npm webpack) ...`. Potential solutions:
 * figure out how to pass `--output-public-path` through `fedx-scripts webpack`
 * see if all frontends can share one directory, and then pass copy-rename
   index.html files.


Figure out volumes (for live repos) for devstack.

Clean up this repo
* makefile targets for docker push
* comments in Makefile + auto-help
* add readme(s), including required folder structure
