Figure out how to do `npm run webpack ...` in each repo instead
of brittle `$(npm webpack) ...`. Potential solutions:
 * figure out how to pass `--output-public-path` through `fedx-scripts webpack`

Add nginx rewrite rules to make redirects more user-friendly
(tolerate trailing slashes, etc.).

Figure out volumes (for live repos) for devstack.

Clean up this repo
* makefile targets for docker push
* comments in Makefile + auto-help
* add readme(s), including required folder structure
