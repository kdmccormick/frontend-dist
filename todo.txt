Issues in this repo:
* Add config for program-console, learning.
* Maybe we shouldn't pass in optimize_minimize, and just let NODE_ENV dictate it.
* Add nginx rewrite rules to tolerate trailing slashes.
* Payments gives blank page.
* Gradebook gives Nginx 404.
* Profile fails in react router.

Clean up for this repo (decreasing priority):
* Shared log_msg/log_warning/log_err functions instead of
  'echo -e "${COL}a message{NC}" >&2 for everything.
* Use 'set -x' instead of echoing commands.
* Use .dockerignore simplify repo structure.
* Makefile targets for docker push.
* Overrides for frontends.lst
* Comments in Makefile + auto-generated 'make help' rule.
* Add readme(s), including required folder structure.

Devstack:
* Figure out volumes for live repositories.

External issues:
* Make login redirects work.
* Use relative paths (handled by 04-apply-shims.sh currently).
* Make env.development compatible (handled by 03-inject-config.sh currently).

Longer term:
* We assume repo names and location. Should be more flexible.
* Move this to tubular or something.
* Config could be JSON.
* Automate docker builds.
