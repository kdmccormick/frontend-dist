Immediate issues in this repo:
* IN PROGRESS: Nginx config needs fixing
	* Nginx rewrite rules aren't letting React app handle routing.
		* Learning gives Nginx 404 on courses and blocks.
		* Profile gives Nginx 404 on user pages.
	* Also, rewrite rules should handle trailing slashes.

To do on kdmccormick/devstack branches:
* Use kdmccormick/devstack branch of kdmccormick/frontend-build.
* Add dev-build command
* Use relative paths in React routing.
* Update .env.development.

Clean up for this repo (in decreasing priority):
* Shared log_msg/log_warning/log_err functions instead of
  'echo -e "${COL}a message{NC}" >&2 for everything.
* Use 'set -x' instead of echoing commands.
* Makefile targets for docker push.
* Overrides for frontends.lst
* Comments in Makefile + auto-generated 'make help' rule.
* Add readme(s), including required folder structure.

External issues:
* Make login redirects work.
* Make env.development compatible (handled by 03-inject-config.sh currently).

Longer term:
* We assume repo name structure and locations. Should be more flexible.
* Move this to tubular or something.
* Config could be JSON.
* Automate docker builds.
