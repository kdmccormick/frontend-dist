============================ NOT REQUIRED FOR DEMO ============================

Clean up for this repo (in decreasing priority):
* Shared log_msg/log_warning/log_err functions instead of
  'echo -e "${COL}a message{NC}" >&2 for everything.
* Use 'set -x' instead of echoing commands.
* Makefile targets for docker push.
* Overrides for frontends.lst
* Comments in Makefile + auto-generated 'make help' rule.
* Add readme(s), including required folder structure.

External issues:
* Make login redirects work.
* Merge in changes to repos.

Longer term:
* We assume repo name structure and locations. Should be more flexible.
* Move this to tubular or something.
* Config could be JSON.
* Automate docker builds.
